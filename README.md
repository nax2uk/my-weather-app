# Weather App

My Weather app is a single React.js page which shows the current weather details and also displays a 7 day forecast of the weather ahead. It fetches weather data from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) using axios. I used CSS to style the webpage and forecast charts are displayed with Highcharts.js.

This is one of the sprints I have done as a student in Northcoders bootcamp, which was completed in a day.
